          Welcome! I am a full-stack developer looking to break into the field of Educational Software development.
          After spending several years as a veterinary technician, I found my calling in teaching theatre to middle school students.
          After losing the funding for my teaching position, I researched ways I could use my IT skills in a new way to continue pursuing my passion of educating our future.
          I have found my next step in development, and I really enjoy the creative front-end work as well as teh more logic driven back-end development.

          Professionally, I have several years of customer service and leadership skills. I am an excellent communicator and collaborator
          while equally comfortable working independently. I have built empathetic listening skills through multiple leadership positions
          and clinical work. I am an agile problem sover and unafraid to make mistakes or admit when I need help.
          My Google skills are growing rapidly!

          In my personal life, I am devoted father to a beautiful son named Ronan. I love to travel and look forward to being able to show my son the world.
          I love reading, creating stories with my son, and gaming. Thursdays are family Roblox nights so you can often find me there
          playing with my son and wife.
